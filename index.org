#+TITLE: Emacs-Experience @<br/> /The/ /Path/ /to/ /Productivity/


* Introduction
This blog serves two purposes:

1. *replace long-term memory:* in case I have to repeat a task later.
2. *share insights:* what took me hours, might take others only
   minutes. 

It should document my way to Emacs-enlightment, i.e. enhanced
productivity by learning one software well instead of many
sketchily. The table of contents shows the topics I'm interested in,
and I hope there will appear more and more blog posts under the
headlines over time.
