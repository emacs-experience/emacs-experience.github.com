#+title: How to write a static Web-App in PicoLisp

* Why would anybody do that?
#+begin_quote
"You can use PicoLisp to generate static HTML pages. This does not make much
sense in itself, because you could directly write HTML code as well, but it
forms the base for interactive applications, and allows us to introduce the
application server and other fundamental concepts."
(from [[http://software-lab.de/doc/app.html][PicoLisp Application Development]])
#+end_quote

* Assumptions
You have a running PicoLisp on your machine and know how to start a
PicoLisp application server that loads your PicoLisp source file
(again, see [[http://software-lab.de/doc/app.html][PicoLisp Application Development]]).

* The ~html~-Function
The ~html~-function is a convenient printing function. It takes four
arguments, that can be followed by an arbritary number of normal Lisp
expressions:
 
1. max-age value for cache-control (zero means "no cache")
2. page-title
3. a CSS-file name (NIL if using no file, a list if using more than
   one)
4. CSS style attribute specification, passed to the ~body~-tag (NIL if
   none)

Example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(html 0 "Hello" "lib.css" NIL
   "Hello Tech-Translation")
#+end_src
